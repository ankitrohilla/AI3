9X9 client_defence  as green defeated when DESIRABILITY_CUTOFF = 1 after 6 turns
9X9 client_harinder as green won      when DESIRABILITY_CUTOFF = 1 after 6 turns because I did not place walls

to rectify the problem, I am changing the findObj() so that if the other player is close to victory, consider it heavy and it worked a bit but still losing to client_harinder

there might be a problem with our minimax as increasing depth makes our player play bad - resolved

i am placing smartness in //    how many horizontal walls can be placed section to prune and select walls effectively
